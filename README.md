# typescript-babel-eslint-prettier

A basic project with Typescript, ESLint, Prettier, and using Babel as the preprocessor for typescript files.

This can serve as a basic typescript starter project. You can build on top of it to replicate what `create-react-app` is doing for frontend projects, or take it in another direction for a backend project.

## Building a Game File Naming Conventions

-   All files that contain only types will have the suffix of `.h` (read: _header file_)
